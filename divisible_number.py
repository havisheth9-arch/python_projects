# 1) Ask the user to enter the numerator and store it in `numn`.
numn = int(input("Enter the numerator: "))
# 2) Ask the user to enter the denominator and store it in `numd`.
numd = int(input("Enter the denominator: "))
# 3) Check if `numn` is divisible by `numd`:
#    - Find the remainder when `numn` is divided by `numd`.
#    - If the remainder is 0, it means perfectly divisible.
remainder = numn % numd
# 4) If divisible, print that `numn` is divisible by `numd`.
if remainder == 0:

# 5) Otherwise, print that `numn` is not divisible by `numd`.
else:
